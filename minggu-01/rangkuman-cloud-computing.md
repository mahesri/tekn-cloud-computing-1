## Cloud Computing Summary
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically uses a pay-as-you-go model, which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for users. The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology's definition of cloud computing identifies "five essential characteristics":
-	On-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
-	Broad network access. Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
-	Resource pooling. The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. 
-	Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
-	Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.[4]

Cloud computing has a history dating back to the 1960s when the concept of time-sharing and Remote Job Entry (RJE) emerged. During this period, the "data center" model prevailed, where users submitted jobs to operators for mainframe processing, aiming to make computing power accessible through time-sharing and enhance efficiency. The term "cloud" as a metaphor for virtualized services can be traced to 1994 when General Magic used it to describe the "places" mobile agents could access in the Telescript environment. This metaphor, coined by David Hoffman of General Magic, found roots in networking and telecom.
In 1996, Compaq Computer Corporation's business plan aimed to leverage "cloud computing-enabled applications" to boost sales. They foresaw the success of online consumer file storage and started selling server hardware to internet service providers. The 2000s marked the practical application of cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was established in 2002, allowing developers to independently create applications. Google Docs, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) launched in the mid-2000s. In 2008, NASA developed open-source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds.
The subsequent decade witnessed the launch of various cloud services. Microsoft introduced Microsoft Azure in 2010, while Rackspace and NASA initiated the open-source project OpenStack. IBM unveiled the IBM SmartCloud framework in 2011, and Oracle announced the Oracle Cloud in 2012. Amazon's AWS Outposts, extending AWS services to customer data centers, was launched in December 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 increased the popularity of cloud technology due to its robust data security and flexibility, especially for remote work scenarios.

One of the primary challenges in cloud computing, compared to traditional on-premises systems, is the concern over data security and privacy. Cloud users must trust third-party providers with their sensitive data, which may not always be adequately protected from unauthorized access, breaches, or leaks. Additionally, compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR or HIPAA can be a challenge for cloud users.
Another significant challenge is the reduced visibility and control that cloud users have over their resources. They may lack insight into how their cloud resources are managed, configured, or optimized by providers, limiting their ability to customize services to their specific needs. Understanding complex cloud technologies and their interconnections can be elusive, given their scale and complexity.
Furthermore, cloud migration presents a substantial obstacle. Cloud migration involves transferring data, applications, or workloads between cloud environments or from on-premises to the cloud. It can be a complex, time-consuming, and costly process, especially when dealing with compatibility issues between different cloud platforms or architectures. Poorly planned migrations can result in downtime, performance issues, or data loss.
The concept of "Everything as a Service" (EaaS or XaaS) is central to service-oriented architecture (SOA) and is operationalized in cloud computing through various service models, as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). These models are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These models are depicted as layers in a stack but are not necessarily interdependent. For example, SaaS can be delivered directly on bare metal without going through PaaS and IaaS, and programs can run directly on IaaS without being packaged as SaaS.

#### Service Models

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: IaaS provides high-level APIs to abstract the underlying network infrastructure, including physical computing resources, location, scaling, security, and more. It involves virtual machines run by hypervisors, and it can offer various resources like virtual machine disk images, block storage, firewalls, load balancers, and more. Users have control over the operating systems, storage, and applications but not the underlying cloud infrastructure.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: PaaS allows developers to deploy applications using supported programming languages, libraries, services, and tools provided by the cloud provider. Users do not manage the underlying infrastructure, including servers and operating systems, but have control over their applications and configurations. PaaS platforms often automatically scale resources to match application demand.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: SaaS enables users to access provider-hosted applications over the internet. Users do not manage the underlying infrastructure, including network, servers, storage, or application capabilities. Instead, they use the software via thin client interfaces such as web browsers. SaaS is typically priced on a subscription or pay-per-use basis and is known for scalability and ease of maintenance.

**Additionally, there are other cloud computing models and trends :**

- Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS): MBaaS provides web and mobile app developers with APIs and SDKs to link their apps to cloud storage and computing services. It includes features like user management, push notifications, and integration with social networking services.

- Serverless Computing or Function as a Service (FaaS): Serverless computing involves cloud providers managing the allocation and scaling of resources based on requests. FaaS, a subset of serverless computing, allows deploying individual functions in response to events without worrying about server management. It's billed based on resource usage rather than per virtual machine per hour.

These cloud service models offer varying levels of abstraction and control over the underlying infrastructure, catering to different use cases and user needs in cloud computing.
